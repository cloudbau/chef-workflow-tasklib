# Chef Workflow - Rake Tasks & Support

This gem provides a set of rake tasks broken up logically to support a chef
workflow, and tooling to assist with driving those tasks. It is intended to
complement a chef repository by directly being added as a dependency.

Some of the tasks it provides are:

* Uploading your cookbooks, roles, environments and databags with the defaults
  expecting a layout similar to the [opscode example
  chef-repo](https://github.com/opscode/chef-repo)
* Resolving your cookbook's dependencies, with tools like
  [librarian](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian) or
  [berkshelf](https://github.com/RiotGames/berkshelf) 
* Lint your cookbooks with [foodcritic](https://github.com/acrmp/foodcritic) 
* Creating a chef server for testing in a single command
* Running unit tests against networks of provisioned machines -- see
  [chef-workflow-testlib](https://github.com/chef-workflow/chef-workflow-testlib)
  for more information.

## We do a lot, but we don't tell you how to do it.

The defaults (which you can set up by following the installation instructions)
use our workflow and a standard chef repository layout. **You don't have to do
this.** Write your own tasks, use a subset of our tasks, configure our tasks to
use your settings, or even adjust what happens when you just type `rake`. The
whole system is built to accomodate this.

## Installation

Many of the choices made designing chef-workflow assume bundler is in use. We
do not recommend installing the gem directly, but through a `Gemfile` that
lives in your repository.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'chef-workflow-tasklib'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

To get started, run the `chef-workflow-bootstrap` utility which will create
some files in your repo. It will not overwrite anything.

    $ bundle exec chef-workflow-bootstrap

If you already had a `Rakefile`, it will not be modified. To use the tasks, add
these two lines to your `Rakefile`:

```ruby
require 'chef-workflow-tasklib'
chef_workflow_task 'default'
```

Then to see all the tasks use:

    $ bundle exec rake -T

**Note:** `rake` by itself will **not work**. We depend on newer gems than the
`rake` that's included with ruby does, which is what will be used if you do not
execute `bundle exec rake`. At this point bundler runs, and will fail because
`rake` will have activated gems that your bundle will be incompatible with.

If this is confusing, just remember to always `bundle exec rake` and you won't
have any trouble.

You should see something similar to this:

```
rake chef:clean                      # Clean up the state files that chef-workflow generates
rake chef:clean:ips                  # Clean up the ip registry for chef-workflow
rake chef:clean:knife                # Clean up the temporary chef configuration for chef-workflow
rake chef:clean:prisons              # Clean up the prison registry for chef-workflow
rake chef:environments:upload        # Upload your environments to the chef server
rake chef:roles:upload               # Upload your roles to the chef server
rake chef:show_config                # Show the calculated configuration for chef-workflow
rake chef_server:build_knife_config  # Create and write a knife configuration suitable for creating new chef servers.
rake chef_server:create:vagrant      # Create a chef server in a vagrant machine.
rake chef_server:destroy:vagrant     # Destroy the last chef server created with vagrant
rake cookbooks:update                # Update your locked cookbooks with Berkshelf
rake cookbooks:upload                # Upload your cookbooks to the chef server
rake test                            # Run tests
rake test:build                      # test:refresh and test
rake test:refresh                    # Refresh all global meta on the chef server
rake test:vagrant:full               # Build a chef server with vagrant, run test:build, destroy the chef server
```

Last step: add `.chef-workflow` to `.gitignore`. You can change this, but
until you've done that, it's going to write things to this directory.

If you want to do a full test run at this point (which with no tests will do
nothing but build a chef server and tear it down), feel free to:

    $ bundle exec test:vagrant:full

## Notes on dependencies

As of this writing, the workflow has some pretty strict requirements that we
hope to make more flexible in the near future. Until then, you should be aware
of a few things:

* Chef 10.16.2 is required. This isn't actually necessary as mentioned above,
  and will be resolved as soon as I can find time to test with earlier
  versions. This has some implications:

    * Tools like `berkshelf` and `librarian` and `foodcritic` (all add-ins to
      the default workflow) have hard dependencies on earlier versions of chef.
      The tasks that integrate these take this into account, but **you must
      install the gems separately and manually to use them**.

* Ruby 1.9 is **required**. We will gladly accept patches to make it 1.8.7
  compatible, but 1.8.7 compatibility is not something we will be actively
  pursuing at this point.

## Usage

Everything in this workflow is managed through usage of `rake` tasks, with an
emphasis on cherry-picking tasks with `chef_workflow_task` into your `Rakefile` and
configuring them with support configurators like `configure_knife` and
`configure_vagrant`.

The next few sections will briefly cover the high-level design of the system.
For details, or information on writing your own tasks, hit the
[wiki](https://github.com/chef-workflow/chef-workflow-tasklib/wiki).

For the basic workflow, note that everything is state tracked between runs for
the most part, so if you build a chef server with `chef_server:create`,
other tasks will just do the right thing and operate on that chef server. This
makes it easy to maintain a edit, upload, test, evaluate, repeat workflow as
you're working on changes. Knife configuration, vagrant "prisons" (See the
wiki) and allocated IPs are all tracked on exit in the `.chef-workflow`
directory.

There are some environment variables which control various settings, like
debugging output. The defaults are usually fine, but check out the "Environment
Variables" section of the
[chef-workflow](https://github.com/chef-workflow/chef-workflow) `README.md`.

## Picking your own workflow

Adding `chef_workflow_task` statements to your workflow is the easiest way to get started.
We don't expect you to use a resolver, for example, but support both
[Berkshelf](https://github.com/RiotGames/Berkshelf) and
[Librarian](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian) out of the box.
Neither of these are required in the default `chef-workflow` require.

Many tasks exist in our [tasks
directory](https://github.com/chef-workflow/chef-workflow-tasklib/tree/master/lib/chef-workflow/tasks)
and we strongly recommend poking through it if you're interested in fully
customizing your workflow. Every attempt has been made for each task library to
pull in only what it needs to operate which allows you to use each independent
portion without fear of missing essential code.

So to add `berkshelf` support, we add this to our Rakefile:

```ruby
chef_workflow_task 'cookbooks/resolve/berkshelf'
```

(If you are using berkshelf 0.4.x or earlier, `chef_workflow_task
'cookbooks/resolve/berkshelf0.4'`)

Which will add a few tasks, `cookbooks:resolve` and `cookbooks:update` and a
few dependencies. **Note:** due to the way many of these tools declare
dependencies, they must be installed independently of the bundle with `gem
install`, so in this case, `gem install berkshelf`. This is out of our control.

Let's build a custom workflow. For example let's say we just want to add:

  * resolving cookbooks with librarian
  * uploading cookbooks
  * uploading roles
  * uploading environments
  * uploading data bags
  * a task that does all of these when we type `bundle exec rake`

*You'll have to point this at your live knife configuration* (see the next
section), but your `Rakefile` would at first look something like this:

```ruby
chef_workflow_task 'cookbooks/resolve/librarian'
chef_workflow_task 'cookbooks/upload'
chef_workflow_task 'chef/roles'
chef_workflow_task 'chef/environments'
chef_workflow_task 'chef/data_bags'

task :default => %w[
  cookbooks:resolve_and_upload
  chef:roles:upload
  chef:environments:upload
  chef:data_bags:upload
]
```

Adding new rake tasks (or even full task libs) is easy too with the extensible
configuration system and scaffolding already in place, and utility libraries to
take the drama out of calling knife plugins or working with collections of
machines. Please see the
[wiki](https://github.com/chef-workflow/chef-workflow-tasklib/wiki) for more
information.

## Configuring the workflow

chef-workflow provides you with a number of pre-baked tasks, but say you need
just one little tweak so you can get with your life.  Maybe it's where the
`.chef-workflow` directory lives or where to work with your cookbooks or what
vagrant box to use, or whatever. You shouldn't have to rewrite the entire task
to change that.

The `configure_knife` and `configure_vagrant` commands have tooling to assist
you with this. If you ran the `chef-workflow-bootstrap` tool, you should have a
file called `lib/chef-workflow-config.rb` which is used to store configuration
in a central place between this and our testing system.

Code like this goes in this file:

```ruby
configure_vagrant do
  # Use this `box_url` for all vagrant machines.
  box_url "http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box"
end

configure_knife do
  roles_path "our-roles" # set the roles directory for chef:roles:upload
end
```

For our custom workflow example above, you can twiddle a few bits with 
`configure_knife` to point at known chef configuration locations, which can use
`~/.chef/knife.rb`, for example. You will want to be careful doing this with
test integration.

`bundle exec rake chef:show_config` can show you most of the settings in a
system and how you've configured them.

Please see the
[wiki](https://github.com/chef-workflow/chef-workflow-tasklib/wiki) for more
information on how to manipulate this for your own tasks.

## What's next?

  * Guard support for change-triggered test runs.
  * Feedback that's more reactive than "everything" or "nothing". The speed (or
    lack thereof) of running large suites makes this especially tricky.
  * See the Issues list for more.

## Problems

  * It's not fast. EC2 support is faster than Vagrant for most complex cases,
    but it's still pretty slow.
  * It has two effective noise levels: "a lot" and "silent".
